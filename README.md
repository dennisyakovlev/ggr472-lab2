# Lab 2

This is the repository for GGR482 lab2.

# Info

The map is created as instructed. The geojsons being added represent my guesses for trying to pinpoint where I stayed in new york last summer. Of course I do not remember the address, and was only allowed to use landmarks from google maps to make my guesses. I eventually get it right.

# Issues

I was not able to get markers/points to display inside of mapbox. I make this note to ask the prof next class.
